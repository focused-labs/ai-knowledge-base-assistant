Focused Labs offers a unique value proposition of enablement, aiming to improve not only the software quality but also the operational quality of their clients' teams and organizations.

2023-11-20 21:54:24,What is the typical process of working with FL as a customer?,"The typical process of working with Focused Labs (FL) begins with a discovery phase, unless the customer already knows precisely what they want to develop. If the requirements are not as clear, FL will engage in discovery to validate which features should be included in the product and which shouldn't. Following that, there's a design phase where interaction with those features and their presentation is considered, and finally, the construction of the software begins.

During the discovery and design process, there is active engagement with the customer, as well as with the customer's customers when relevant, to ensure that assumptions made about the domain fit and that the features being designed are prioritized correctly. Practitioners from FL work closely with and maintain continuous communication with everyone involved.

Day-to-day operations during the development phase are highly interactive and engaging, with a process that includes:

1. **Weekly Iterations**: Starting with iteration planning meetings at the beginning of the week, the team picks which features, bugs, and chores from the backlog need to be addressed.

2. **Daily Stand-ups**: Daily meetings are held to discuss what was done the previous day, what needs to be done today, and any blockers to progress.

3. **Retrospectives**: At the end of the week, the team reflects on the week's work to determine what was successful and what wasn't, in order to improve the process moving forward.

4. **Demo and Delivery**: Features are completed and demonstrated as working software to the customers at the end of every week, ensuring that progress can be seen and fine-tuned throughout the engagement, rather than just at the end.

This continuous feedback loop and communication ensure that the software developed by FL is aligned with the customer's vision and requirements throughout the entire process【11†source】.",

2023-11-20 21:56:32,What are the benefits of custom built software?,"Custom-built software, often referred to as bespoke software, is specifically designed and developed to meet the unique requirements of an organization or user. Here are several benefits of custom-built software:

1. **Tailored Solution**: Custom software is designed to align precisely with the business processes and requirements of an organization, ensuring a perfect fit for the intended purpose.

2. **Scalability**: As a company evolves, its software needs can change. Custom software can be scaled in response to an organization's growth and changing needs, unlike off-the-shelf software which might have limitations.

3. **Integration**: Custom software can be built to integrate seamlessly with the organization's existing systems, improving workflow and productivity.

4. **Competitive Advantage**: With unique features not available in standard products, custom software can provide businesses with a competitive edge by offering distinctive functionalities tailored to their specific market or customers.

5. **Efficiency**: By automating specific tasks unique to your organization, custom software can help to improve efficiency and reduce the time and resources spent on manual operations.

6. **Ownership and Control**: Owning the software outright eliminates ongoing licensing fees, and the owner has full control over any future updates or changes to the application.

7. **Security**: Custom-built software can be more secure than off-the-shelf alternatives as it's a less attractive target for attackers and can be designed with specific security features in mind.

8. **Support and Maintenance**: Custom software developers can provide dedicated support and maintenance services for the software they create, which might lead to faster response times and issue resolutions.

9. **Long-Term Cost Savings**: Whilst the initial investment might be higher, over the long term, custom software might reduce costs as there are no recurring license fees, and it may streamline business operations to save money elsewhere.

10. **Adaptability**: As market demands or regulatory requirements change, custom software can be more quickly adapted relative to commercial software that depends on the schedule of the vendor.

Each of these benefits plays a crucial role in contributing to the success of an organization that opts for a custom-built software solution. However, it's also important to consider the higher initial cost, longer development time, and the need for a competent development partner when deciding whether custom software is the best choice for a given scenario.",
2023-11-20 21:57:14,What is TDD?,"Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on a short development cycle called a ""red-green-refactor."" This process is characterized by the following steps:

1. Write a test: Before writing the functional code, a developer writes a test for a new function or feature.
2. Run the test: This test will fail initially (red phase) since the feature isn't implemented yet.
3. Write the code: The developer writes the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test.
4. Run the tests: If the tests pass, the developer has succeeded (green phase). If they fail, the code needs to be adjusted until the test passes.
5. Refactor: Once the tests pass, the developer can refactor the code to improve its structure, performance, or maintainability with the security that the test will catch breaks in functionality.

The point of TDD is to ensure that the code has been thoroughly tested before it's considered complete. It helps prevent regressions (where changes break existing functionality) and can lead to a more modular, flexible codebase. TDD also encourages simple designs and inspires confidence in the software.",
2023-11-20 21:57:25,What is agile?,"Agile is a set of principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.

The Agile mindset is often contrasted with traditional waterfall project management, where requirements are defined up front, and the project is then executed in a sequential design process. Agile, on the other hand, is iterative, allowing for changes and refinements through the life of a project.

There are several frameworks and methodologies that fall under the Agile umbrella, such as Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and Lean software development. Each framework has its own practices, but they all align with the values and principles expressed in the Agile Manifesto.

The core values of Agile, as stated in the Agile Manifesto, are:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

These values are supported by 12 guiding principles which provide further insight into how to carry out an Agile project. The focus on people, working solutions, collaboration, and adaptability has made Agile popular across many industries, not just software development.",

2023-11-20 21:58:25,"As a prospective employee, do I have to always pair program?","At Focused Labs, pair programming is the default practice, which means that the majority of your engineering time will be spent pairing with another person. However, it is a flexible practice, and there are circumstances that might allow for some solo work, such as when there is an odd number of team members or specific conditions that make pairing less feasible. Pairing at Focused Labs involves two equal partners working together on one computer but with two of everything else, like monitors and keyboards. The company tries to rotate pairs daily unless there is a pressing need for continuity in the context. Overall, it's a core collaboration practice at Focused Labs, and you should expect to spend a fair amount of time pairing【9†source】.",
